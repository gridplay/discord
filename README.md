# GridPlay Discord Bot
i need help with this one

Ever since discord.js changed their package it has become very confusing for me to use it

And since i dont really know javascript i really need help with this one

What i like to use it for is for chat from within SecondLife to a discord channel and be able to message discord users when their GridPlay support ticket receives a reply.

Now the old way i would of been able to do that but since the upgrade the main.js script been throwing console errors.

Thank you so much for anyone who helps with this project.

Sincerely Chris aka Venx84 of GridPlay.Productions
